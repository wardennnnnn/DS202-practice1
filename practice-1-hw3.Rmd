## GitHub Links

#number of successful pull requests you made, 
#and the github repository to which you requested a change
numPullReqMade = c(1,0,0)
repoRequested = c("vvrin", "wardennnnnn", "repoReq3")

#number of pull requests you accepted, 
#and the github repository from which you accepted
numPullReqAccepted = c(2,0,0)

## Three Tips
1. Add comments within your push/pull requests. Not only does this help your team members understand the changes you made to the file but, you'll know what you added. 
2. Create descriptive names for repositories and files. By doing so you know exactly what the file was designed for and won't have trouble distinguishing between projects. 
3. Pull frequently. By pulling frequently you can avoid issues that may appear as a result of multiple changes.

## Graphs
Generate the graph of LifExp vs. gdpPercap for US, Canada (fixed data) and Australia by RMarkdown based on the data set “gapminder-5060”.

```{r}
life5060_US = life5060[life5060$country == "United States",]
ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap), data = life5060_US) + geom_line()

life5060_Australia = life5060[life5060$country == "Australia",]
ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap), data = life5060_Australia) + geom_line()

life5060_Canada = life5060[life5060$country == "Canada",]
ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap), data = life5060_Canada) + geom_line()

```
